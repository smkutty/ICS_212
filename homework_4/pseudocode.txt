addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (interger)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

define an int called added
define a pointer to record called temp
allocate heap space and set address to temp

copy from temp to start in the record WITH PREVIOUS ADDRESS


copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in temp
copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in temp
copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in temp
copy from NULL to start in the record whose address is in temp

return added


my notes:
1. allocate heap space, set address to temp
2. previous record start = temp
3. add accountno to list
4. put values into record
